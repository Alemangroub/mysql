# Blueprint: Elemannet - Project & Installment Management Dashboard

## 1. Overview

This application is a web-based project management dashboard named "Elemannet". It is designed for administrators to create, monitor, and manage various construction or contracting projects, as well as handle customer contracts and installment plans. The platform provides a centralized view of all projects and contracts, with detailed pages for tracking work progress, expenses, and payment schedules. Supervisors can submit daily reports and expense claims, while administrators manage the financial and contractual aspects.

## 3. Previous Task: Add Project-Specific Installment Management

### Plan & Steps for the requested change:

1.  **[Completed] Add "Add Installment" Button:** Modified the `project-installments.astro` page to include a new "إضافة قسط" (Add Installment) button in the header.
2.  **[Completed] Create "Add Installment" Page:** Created a new page at `src/pages/admin/add-installment.astro`.
3.  **[Completed] Build the Form & Logic:**
    -   Designed a form with fields for amount, due date, and status.
    -   Added Firebase logic to fetch the project's name for the header.
    -   Implemented the `addDoc` function to save the new installment to the `installments` collection in Firestore, including the `projectId`.
4.  **[Completed] Implement Authentication:** Secured the new page to ensure only `admin` users can access it.
5.  **[Completed] Finalize Navigation:** Ensured that after adding an installment, the user is redirected back to the `project-installments` page to see the updated list.
6.  **[Completed] Update Blueprint:** Updated this `blueprint.md` file to document the new feature and mark the task as complete.

## 4. Current Task: Fix Installment Status Dropdown UI

### Plan & Steps for the requested change:

1.  **[Identify Issue]** The "Paid/Pending" status dropdown in the `contract-details.astro` page was not fully visible on smaller screens (mobile view) because its width was constrained.
2.  **[Implement Fix]** Modified the global stylesheet within `src/pages/admin/contract-details.astro`. Specifically, I adjusted the CSS rule targeting the `select` element within the installments table. I removed the `width: 100%` property from the `select` dropdown, allowing it to size automatically based on its content ("مستحق" / "مدفوع"). This ensures the full text is always visible.
3.  **[Update Blueprint]** Updated this `blueprint.md` file to document the UI fix and mark the task as complete.
